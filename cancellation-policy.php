        <h3>Cancellation Policy
        </h3>
        <p>The Assignment Writing preserves all rights to drop your order any time under severe circumstances. We feel
            pride in maintaining that we never reject any order due to its difficulty level and deadlines. Nevertheless,
            we hold the independent rights of rejection or order cancellation.
        </p>
        <h4>Cancellation applies under certain conditions:

        <h3>NOTE:
