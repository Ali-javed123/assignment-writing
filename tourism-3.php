            <p>Interpretation: In order to run program for reducing pollution and bring sustainability in society, the
                basic resources needed by Transport for London is adequate amount of funds. As without arranging proper
                amount of finance, it cannot runs its major operations in more effective manner. For this purpose, it
                can take funds from Department for Transport, Borrow and cash movement, Fares income etc. Through
                survey, it has interpreted from above graph that 15 respondents suggest this firm to arrange finance by
                Fares income. Whereas 10 users bring attention towards borrowing and cash movement. They think by
                lending money from commercial institution, Transport for London can satisfy its requirements related to
                finance. While, remaining 5 users thinks that funds from Department for Transport will help this firm to
                get rid from financial issues.

            </h5>
            <p>In 2014, carrying amount is $200000, whereas recoverable amount implies for $110000. Hence, carrying
                amount is higher than recoverable cost which shows the loss of $90000. Carrying cost – recoverable
                amount $200000 – $110000 = $90000

            <h4>QUESTION 3
            </h4>
            <h5>Interpreting the technical requirements and importance of international accounting standards
            </h5>
            <p>International Accounting standards have high level of importance which ensures high level transparency
                and standardization in the financial statements. Hence, final accounts which are prepared according to
                IFRS are highly reliable in nature and thereby helps stakeholders in making decisions (Florou, Kosi and
                Pope, 2017). However, technical knowledge is highly required among the individuals or accounting
                personnel to deal with the aspects of International Accounting Standards such as IAS 12 and 26 etc. In
                this, accounting personnel must have ability to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities. Moreover,
                assets, revenue received in advance, other liabilities, unrecognized items; consolidated financial
                statements are the main bases of taxation (Warren, 2016). By taking into consideration all such bases
                accounting personnel can assess or determine the tax liability. In addition to this, in IAS 12 contains
                rules regarding the measurement of deferred tax. Along with this, tax rate are also varied from one year
                to another. In this, accounting personnel is required to update with changing rules and policies.
                Through this, finance manager and accounting personnel would become able to determine suitable tax
                liability. In addition to this, IAS 26 serves information about retirement plans which can be
                distinguished into two types such as defined benefit and contribution plan. Hence, it clearly presents
                information about the recording, measurement and disclosure of information regarding the retirement
                benefit plans. Hence, for effective presentation accounting personnel must have knowledge regarding the
                rules and regulations which are related to it (Bond, Govendir and Wells, 2016). Thus, by considering all
                such aspects it can be said that technical and conceptual knowledge is highly required for dealing with
                the standards more effectively and efficiently. Moreover, reporting and measurement aspect of pension
                plan is highly differing from one standard to another (McPhail, Macdonald and Ferguson, 2016). For
                instance: UK GAAP has different rules in relation to treatment on pension benefits in against to IAS.
                Hence, conceptual understanding and knowledge is highly required for dealing with the amount of
                retirement benefits and deferred tax amount. There are several key issues which are associated with
                financial reporting enumerated below:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reporting needs and requirements are mentioned in the regulations which business entity requires
                    following for ensuring transparency in the final accounts. However, sometimes is not possible for
                    the business organization to comply with all the rules to the large extent.
                </li>
                <li>Further, some government authorities have framed and introduced legislation which entail that
                    companies are not obliged to prepare financial statements according to accounting standards.
                    Moreover, sometimes treasurer directives also enforce accounting standard which company has to
                    follow for the preparation of financial statements.
                </li>
            </ul>
