            assistance. Our services are aimed to help you with research, as well as acquire knowledge in the given
            subject so that you can create your own, 100% original work. This means that the work we provide you should
            only be used as a guide to create your own piece of work and not be submitted directly to the university.
        </p>
        <p>So, before opting for our services, we suggest you go through our Fair Use Policy to understand how should
            you use the work that we deliver to you. We have tried to keep this policy simple, but if at any point you
            come up with queries, then feel free to contact us using the details mentioned at the end of this page.
        </p>
        <h3>Why Do We Have a Fair Use Policy?
        </h3>
        <p>The main purpose of our writing services is to help you conduct further research and utilize the information
            to write your own documents. However, many students submit the work purchased from us directly to their
            professor to save themselves from the hard work. But this is not how our services should be used because
            this is a form of plagiarism.
        </p>
        <p>We have this Fair Use Policy to make you understand that the work delivered to you is copyrighted and the
            best way to get benefit from it is by considering it as a guide to take notes and ideas, conduct further
            research, and then create your own scholarly work.
        </p>
        <p>The reference papers that our researchers create give students an example of how a specific topic should be
            handled so that they can form an entirely different view on that subject matter. It helps them gain a
            perspective to write their papers, collect relevant data from credible sources, and learn the proper
            formatting. So, instead of submitting our work as your own, you should use it for the following purposes:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><p>Go through the entire paper to acquire knowledge of the topic and understand how the question has been
                answered.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Take a read through each section and paragraph again to focus on important points and make notes.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Now try to come up with your own ideas and arguments from the notes that you have prepared.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Find the sources mentioned in the paper provided by us and review them.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Use these resources to conduct further research and gather more relevant information.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Make further notes on what you want to cover in your work from the information that you have collected.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Make sure that your final document is 100% authentic and completely based on your own ideas and
                perspective.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Conducting your research and creating 100% original work will take a lot more efforts than simply submitting
            our reference paper as your work to gain academic credit. But, by doing so, you will get a thorough
            understanding of the given topic and prepare well for exams.
        </p>

        <h4>Why Can’t You Submit Our Work to the University as Your Own?
        </h4>
        <p>Our researchers and writers work tirelessly to gather the best data and produce excellent papers to help you
            get acquire knowledge of the topic and compose your own documents with a new perspective. Everything they
            create is entirely original and written exactly as per your instructions. We never upload our work on the
            web which means that it will never end up being flagged by plagiarism scanners. It also means that if you
            submit the model papers as your own work, there is no way that your professor will get to know that you have
            used our services.
        </p>
        <p>However, your professor could realize the fact that your style of writing doesn’t match to the paper, or that
            you have used sources that you don’t have access to or sufficient knowledge to find. He/she may even ask you
            to explain the work back to them, which would get you into trouble if you have handed the work as it is.
            Submitting the paper we have created as your own is plagiarism which can lead to serious consequences. Even
            if you rephrase our work, it will still be counted as unoriginal according to your university guidelines and
            standards.
        </p>
        <p>So, we strongly recommend you to abide by this Fair Use Policy and use our academic writing services as
            intended. Complying with our policy will help you write an excellent paper, improve your grades, and give
            you a sense of satisfaction that you have done an honest job.
        </p>

            trouble, you may be thinking that why should you buy our reference papers then. To this, we have to say that
