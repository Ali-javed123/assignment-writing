            <p>INTRODUCTION on Modern Movement Democracy
            </p>
            <p>“The phenomenon of architecture is a development of the phenomenon of man.”
            </p>
            <p>Topic
            </p>
            <p>The topic for the dissertation is that how the modern movement in architecture has affected the field of
                architecture and what are the current challenges. The dissertation will talk about the effects of the
                modern architecture has brought in along with the challenges that came in modern movement in
                architecture. Whether the affects are positive or negative will be studied in the dissertation. The
                field of architecture is defined as the process that involves planning followed by designing and
                construction of buildings. The works of architecture in forms of materials is assumed to be as symbols
                and works of art. The term architecture is used to describe activities involved in construction
                (Kapitzke, 2006). It is considered to be as a science or an art both for describing buildings and other
                physical structure. Architecture is a term related to architect where services are rendered by
                professionals related to designing and constructing buildings. Planning and designing of buildings
                includes in it deciding upon ambience and space within and around them. Also, it includes to plan about
                all sorts of aesthetic and environmental considerations (Allison and Eshun, 2006).
            </p>
            <p>Context of topic
            </p>
            <p>The modern movement in architecture has brought in a lot of changes in this field. The need of
                architecture is to creatively bring out newer and newer approaches and ideas for construction of
                buildings. Modern movement in architecture needs to manipulate and then properly coordinate available
                materials and technology. With the advancement of new and new technologies, there are more number of
                ways and reforms in the field of architecture. The field of architecture not only focuses on
                construction of building but also on estimation of cost related to various activities in it and their
                administration (Gehl, 2007). Architects not only design buildings or other physical structures but also
                aims to visualize and imagine future which involve forecasting that how the building can sustain in
                future. It makes use of various aspects of mechanical and structural engineering along with humanities
                and arts in order to design and construct buildings and other physical structures.

            <p>Research questions
            </p>
            <ol>
                <ul>
                    <p>How the modern movement has affected the field of architecture?
                    </p>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <p>What are the challenges due to this on architecture?
                    </p>
                </ul>
            </ol>
            <p>Modern movement in architecture was a movement which took place in the 1920s and is considered to be a
                dramatic shift in designs of buildings different from the traditional ones. The techniques in
                construction were now shifted towards a new era of designs from the past. It not only leads to the
                development of new designs but also formed new tools and techniques that can be employed in the
                buildings. With this movement, the architects started using steel and other manufacturing materials.
            </p>
            <p>The above research questions are related entirely to the topic and aims to find that whether modern
                movement has an effect on architecture and if it has then how it has been affected. The research
                questions are interesting and motivate the researcher as the study will result in understanding of how
                changes have taken place in the aspect of designing buildings. The topic of the particular study is
                relevant today because architecture is one such field which is growing continuously and more and more
                new designs are developing today. So it will be interesting to know about the developed designs which
                developed as a result of the modern movement.
            </p>
            <p>Relevancy of topic
            </p>
            <p>Earlier various forms of architecture were used which were known as the traditional approaches but now
                with changing times various advanced forms have come into role. The international and modern styles are
                the ones which make use of modern equipments and materials in such a way that they provide with new and
                innovative designs to the professionals in this field. Contemporary styles of architecture are those
                which are used today and provide great opportunities for the designers. The topic chosen for the
            </p>
            <p>Assignment Help is quite relevant in the sense that it will help the present day architectures to know
                that how the buildings were designed according to the traditional methods and what changes this field
                have experienced after the modern movement. Also, it helps to find the challenges which are faced by
                them because of this movement.
            </p>
            <p>Approach towards the topic
            </p>
            <p>Modern movements in democracy in the field of architecture have helped architects to understand modern
                techniques in this field and utilize the benefits that are provided through it.
            </p>
            <p>In this
            </p>
            <p>Assignment Help, discussion will focus on how modern changes in democracy have added to benefits in the
                area of architecture. It will show that how modernism in architecture has evolved and how it is
                followed. Also, the various challenges ahead of architects will also be given emphasis. Due to the
                democracy what changes are faced by architectures in order to bring new and new innovation in
                construction will be given emphasis. In order to proceed in the particular research, secondary source of
                data will be used. The methodology used will be from articles which are published in online journals and
                books. In addition to this, information will also be taken from online websites which are reliable. In
                order to support the hypothesis formed and the research questions, case studies will be provided. This
                will help to support the hypothesis and reach to a final conclusion.

            <p>“Fashion is architecture: it is a matter of proportions”
            </p>
            <p>Introduction
            </p>
            <p>Earlier in the medieval period in Europe, the names of the architects of buildings remain unknown and it
                was not added against any of them. But then, a period came when craftsmen started to organize their own
                trades and through this their contacts were added and survived. After that in renaissance Europe, a
                revival took place and more emphasis was laid on how an individual contribute to the construction of
                buildings and the society as a whole (We and Dijkstra, 2010).
            </p>
            <p>Modern architecture is that form of architecture which has features that has made it superior to all
                other earlier forms in construction. This form ahs main features as of simplicity and does not make use
                of applied decoration.
            </p>
            <p>Definition of topic
            </p>
            <p>The approach of modern arhcitecture is being adopted by modern architectural professionals and is one of
                the most dominant styles of architecture. Its main purpose was to use the materials and equipments in a
                rational manner and thereby rejecting the historical styles and ornaments (Modern architecture, 2013).
            </p>
            <p>The main features of modern architecture includes, firstly, that it followed the concept of ‘form follows
                function’ which means that a design should result into such that it could directly reveal the purpose of
                the building and its design.
            </p>
            <p>Another style is sustainable design which is based on the philosophy that all materials and objects to be
                used in construction shall be such that they are in compliance with economic and social sustainability.
                This is done in order to make use of sensitive designs in construction so that negative impact on the
                environment can be eliminated. Such type of buildings also aims to increase the connectivity of
                environment with people so that more and more meaningful innovations of this type can be created (Allen,
                2000).
            </p>
            <p>A new form of architecture that leads to the benefits of architectures was novelty architecture. This is
                a type of approach in which buildings are given a unique or unusual shape which can be considered to be
                a landmark. These are used by the industries for advertising their products as they can resemble the
                products sold by them (Sibley, 2007).
